# Welcome to the C Programming section.

## Project One - Hexadoku solver
I created a spin-off of the classic game sodoku, but this is hexadoku, which is a 16 by 16 grid. 

This program solves any hexadoku that is possible. Can also flag ones that are not possible to be solved

## Project Two - Housing Prices
We were given a machine learning algorithm to predcit future housing prices given current data.

I had to use a ton of matrices and pointers to get this done, including some linear algebra work.
