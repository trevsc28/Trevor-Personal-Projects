# Welcome to the C Programming section.

## Project One - Hexadoku solver
I created a spin-off of the classic game sodoku, but this is hexadoku, which is a 16 by 16 grid. 

This program solves any hexadoku that is possible. Can also flag ones that are not possible to be solved

## Project Two - Housing Prices
We were given a machine learning algorithm to predcit future housing prices given current data.

I had to use a ton of matrices and pointers to get this done, including some linear algebra work.

## Project Three - Cache Simulator
I created a cache simulator with prefetching in C. You give it all the parameters, and it spits back the hits and misses with and without prefetches. Requires large file of data.  

## Project Four - Circuit Simulator
I created a digital logic circuit simualtor which not only includes logical operations like AND/OR/NOR, but includes more complex operations like DECODER and MULTIPLEXER. You input a circuit using these operations, followed by gray code input, and it spits out the binary circuit for each run.
