# Supermarket Simulator

This 'supermarket simulator' is used as a neat visual to understand stacks and queues. 


In order to do this project, I used a deque (pronounced 'deck') in Java to emulate a stack, and a queue.
The registers are 'stacks' as it uses LIFO (last in - first out)
The customer lines, or 'customer queues' are 'queues' as it uses FIFO (first in - first out)

I wrote this in high school to demonstrate stacks and queues. 

### Run
