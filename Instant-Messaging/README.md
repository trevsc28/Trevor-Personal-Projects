# Instant Messaging Server and Client 

I wrote this in High School as part of a class project. It is a server class and a client class. Multiple clients can connect to the server. 

An announcement is created every time a new user joins, sent to the entire chat. 

Might not be the best optimized - wrote it in high school. 

Written using Java Sockets.

Just run the server first, following up any amount of clients on the same port.
