# Welcome to the OCaml section

I took a class at Rutgers University - New Brunswick which offered insight to the core principles of programming languages, including lambda calculus, ocaml, and prolog.

## BasicOCAML.ml
This project was just to test the features and limits of the langauge, just basic syntax stuff

## Lists.ml
This project was to test out 'real world' OCaml, including references, cells, and modules

## PrologParser.ml
This project was the final project for the class. We had to create a prolog parser using only ocaml or python. I chose ocaml. Prolog would get sent into the parser by using structures
