#Maze Runner Algorithms

This one is a bit more complicated ( also done in Highschool, graphics don't scale :( )

Basically, there are three maze runners running on different algorithms.
 
*Algorithms used
  * Random Robot - moves randomly across the board
  * Right Hand Robot - will always take the right hand wall
  * Flood Fill Robot - will use the 'flood fill' algorithm to read the end
  
It pins these three together in a user generated maze, on the maze.txt file

To edit the maze, use the maze.txt file, 0 for empty space, 1 for wall, and then 2/3 for starting position and ending position

This application is an applet, head to main.java to run this program, and run as an applet. Thanks!
